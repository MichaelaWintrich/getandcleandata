files for the peer reviewed assessments of week 3 of "getting and cleaning data"

This R script uses human activity data built from recordings of users of smartphones. 
The full description of the data set is available at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The code does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Please see also the codebook in this repo.
