# Introduction

The script `run_analysis.R`
- Downloads data from the data set http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  
# The Code

The script assumes that `plyr` library is already installed.
It is structured according to functions that each perform one of the steps described above. 


# The data set

The data set used is structured in a way that there are two sets, training and tests. Each set is divided into separate files holding
- measurements from the accelerometer & gyroscope
- activity label
- identifier of the subject

# Getting and cleaning the data

1) The script checks whether the data is already saved in the workspace. If not, it is downloaded from the UCI repository.

2) The script merges the above mentioned test and training sets.
The merged data set contains 10,299 cases with 561 features each (560 measurements and subject identifier). 

3) Mean and standard deviation are extracted, resulting in 33 mean and 33 standard
deviations features each, and creating a data frame with 68 features (with two added features from subject identifier and activity label).

4) Activity labels are turned into clear and descriptive activity names.

5) A tidy data set is created. It contains the the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
10299 instances are sorted into 180 groups (30 subjects, 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard deviations are averaged for each group. The resulting data table has 180 rows and 66 columns.
The tidy data set is exported to `UCI_HAR_tidy.txt`.
